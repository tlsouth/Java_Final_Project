# Java_Final_Project
Repository containing the code for Survival of the Sequenced, a game written in Java.

This project was completed by Morgan Chunn and Tyler Southworth.

Within the folder titled 'SOS', there are three folders:
  - 'SOS' containing the code for the program (SOS_Final.java)
  - 'SOS_Images' containing all images needed for the program
  - 'SOS_Audio' containing all images needed for the program
  
Things we would do/add to our SOS game given more time:
  - A dynamic way of having more than two options for the story, this would allow greater branching and more varied story outcomes
  - A dynamic way to change the prompts/images so we donâ€™t have copy and paste code
  - Split the GUI up to to follow the MVC framework 
  - After the JOptionPane spawns telling the user they've died and to hit 'Start' to try again, the GUI prompt and image progress to the next event as if       the player had not died. The option buttons are disabled, so the only thing the player can do is restart. This is not a fatal issue, just a cosmetic       one
