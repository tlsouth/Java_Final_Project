# Java_Final_Project
Repository containing the code for Survival of the Sequenced, a game written in Java.

This project was completed by Morgan Chunn and Tyler Southworth.

Within the folder titled 'SOS', there are three folders:
  - 'SOS' containing the code for the program
  - 'SOS_Images' containing all images needed for the program
  - 'SOS_Audio' containing all images needed for the program
  
Things we would do/add to our SOS game given more time:
  - A dynamic way of having more than two options for the story, this would allow greater branching and more varied story outcomes.
  - A dynamic way to change the prompts/images so we donâ€™t have copy and paste code.
  - Split the GUI up to to follow the MVC framework
